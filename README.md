## Eloquent JavaScript Studies

This repo was created with a study purpose to practice exercises and build tests in Javascript, based on the [Eloquent JS book](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).

### Focus
For these first tests, we are focusing on functions dealing with objects and arrays - shown on [Chapter 4](https://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html) of the book.

### Stack

For the tests of the functions, we are using the following stack:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - *a javascript testing framework*
- JavaScript Vanilla
